You should instead use the attribute `android:dataExtractionRules`, specifying an `@xml` resource that configures which files to back up, for cloud backups and for device-to-device transfers, separately. If your `minSdkVersion` supports older versions, you&apos;ll still want to specify an `android:fullBackupContent` resource if the default behavior is not right for your app."
